# Maximum Flow Algorithm in Kotlin

## Introduction
This project implements the Maximum Flow Algorithm in Kotlin. The algorithm is used to determine the maximum flow in a network and optimize the transmission of data.

## Usage
The code can be used to analyze a given network and determine the maximum flow that can be achieved in that network. Simply provide the network parameters as inputs and the algorithm will determine the maximum flow.

## Requirements
- Kotlin 1.4 or above
